# Simulation
CSCI41 Simulation Project: Kamilah, Kenneth &amp; Kory

Theme: A character is lost and trying to find there way home. 
In order to get there they must move through the world and solve riddles/puzzles/etc.

Kamilah: Scripting
Create a entry/exit scroll that explains the game and add whatever extra details you think will give the game
more appeal. Your scripting will most likely sit in int main() or can be part of a function call depending
on how you would like to do it.

Kenneth: Mapping
Create a map class for the game, with constructors, destructors, function calls to move, etc.

Kory: Challenges
I know we already said puzzles/riddles but im leaving that open to you as to what you want to happen as the
character moves through out the game. As im writing the code now, i have that as the character move they hit
a number and that number gets sent into a function called puzzle. That function will be where you can create
the challenges they have to overcome.
